The error is from **flake8**:
```
product_api.py:1:17: E999 SyntaxError: invalid character '\u2019' (U+2019)
```
This means line 1, column 17 of `product_api.py` contains the character `’` (Unicode U+2019, right single quotation mark), which is not a valid apostrophe in Python.  
Replace it with a regular single quote `'‘`.

---

Assuming a typical line 1 could look like:
```python
api_key = ‘BXmWNyyF…z9s8’
```
Corrected:
```python
api_key = 'BXmWNyyF…z9s8'
```
Or if the file starts with, say,
```python
def get_product(id):
    # function content
```
the issue could be with any occurrence of `’` in the file.

---

**Please replace ALL occurrences of `’` (U+2019) with `'` (U+0027).**

---

### Corrected `product_api.py`

```python
# Example corrected file

api_key = 'BXmWNyyF************************************************************************z9s8'

def get_product(id):
    # Replace this with actual product-fetching logic
    pass
```

**Note:**  
- If there were more instances of the curly quote (`’`), replace them similarly.  
- The content above is a placeholder—adjust according to your actual file.

If you provide the full file content, I can perform a complete fix. Otherwise, search and replace every `’` with `'`.
