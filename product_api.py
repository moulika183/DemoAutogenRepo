The key CI error is:

```
product_api.py:1:17: E999 SyntaxError: invalid character '\u2019' (U+2019)
```

This means your `product_api.py` file contains an invalid character at position 17 of line 1. The character `’` (U+2019) is a typographic (curly) apostrophe and should be replaced with a regular ASCII apostrophe `'` (U+0027).

**Here’s what to do:**

- Replace all curly quotes or apostrophes with straight ASCII equivalents.

Assuming your file starts with something like:  
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/product', methods=[‘POST’])
def create_product():
    data = request.get_json()
    # Your logic here
    return jsonify(data)
```
Note the curly quotes around 'POST'.

**Corrected version:**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/product', methods=['POST'])
def create_product():
    data = request.get_json()
    # Your logic here
    return jsonify(data)
```

**Summary of fix:**  
- Change: `methods=[‘POST’]`  
- To:    `methods=['POST']`

**Full corrected `product_api.py`:**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/product', methods=['POST'])
def create_product():
    data = request.get_json()
    # Your logic here
    return jsonify(data)
```

If you have more curly quotes elsewhere, fix them all similarly. Let me know if you need further help!
