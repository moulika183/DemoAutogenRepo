The error you received indicates that your code is sending an invalid API key to the OpenAI API:

> Incorrect API key provided: BXmWNyyF************************************************************************z9s8. You can find your API key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.

To fix this, you must:

1. Replace the incorrect API key with a valid one.
2. Make sure your API key is not hardcoded (for security), use environment variables.

Here's the corrected code (assuming the code is named `openai_example.py`):

```python
import os
import openai

# Get your API key securely from environment variables
openai.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

if not openai.api_key:
    raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not set. Set it in your environment before running this script.")

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
    ]
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Usage instructions

1. **Set your API key in your environment** (never hardcode it):
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxx...   # Replace with your real API key
    ```

2. **Run your script**.

**Summary of changes:**
- Removed the hardcoded API key.
- Used environment variable for API key retrieval.
- Added a check for missing API key.
